## 25/25 Goal 2 - Run 5km in under 20 mins

I thought this was going to be a pretty achievable goal as I’ve come close to getting this time in the past but with a trip to the UK and then catching a nasty cold upon my return I went about 3 or 4 weeks with no training in the run up for this and even on the day I had a real head-full and didn’t fancy running it. Thought about skipping it and just trying to beat this time running by myself somewhere but in the end I decided that as I’d paid the entrance fee I might as well give it a go.  
 
Left a little late and didn’t really know the way to the venue but eventually found the place and riding the bike there ended up being quite a good warm-up. The event was being held in Nagai-koen (長居公園) which is a massive park in the south of Osaka. There are a couple of sports stadiums inside the park and lots of other strange things like a little sumo arena for school kids. It was a lovely sunny day and was actually a little warmer than I’d wanted it to be as I’d gotten used to running in the cold. The race was going to start just ahead of schedule so it ended up all being a bit hectic but things calmed down once I found my group and got in place at the start line.  
 
The groups were split up by predicted times and so I was in the middle group of people aiming for times of 18-21 minutes. 21 people were in the group and there were four pacemakers running at 18, 19, 20 and 21 minute paces respectively. I had a good look at the 20 minute guy and as soon as we started I got on his shoulder and stuck with him the whole way. The group was quite bunched up so it was tricky running the inside lane on some bits but it started to spread out a little after the first few laps. As we were running on a 400m track it was 12.5 laps for the total race.  
 
The pace felt fine for the first 8 laps or so and then started getting really tough. It felt to me like they were speeding up and I was really breathing hard and felt like I had a stitch coming on. I managed to get back into my rhythm for a couple of laps but then at laps 10 and 11 I started falling behind the group a little and thought I might have lost it. But then when I realised that two and a half laps is only 1km and managed to dig deep and catch up with the pacemaker. Coming into the last half lap my lungs were really feeling raw and I couldn’t how much time was left on the clock. As I came into the final straight I could see I had almost a whole minute left though and thanks to some great trackside support from Yuri I found the energy for a final push and started my sprint for the finish line. I passed the pacemaker with a good 100 meters or so to go and managed to accelerate all the way over the line.  
 
My final time was 19 minutes and 44 seconds. I had to sit down after I finished as I was absolutely knackered and really panting away. It was a great feeling though and I was so chuffed to do it in a time that was even better than I’d expected. I thought before the race that at best I might get just over 20 mins. I wonder what time I could’ve got if I hadn’t had a cold!  
 
All in all it was a great event and I left feeling better than I have after any of the other races I’ve taken part in. Think 5km is probably the distance that I enjoy the most. One down 24 more to go!
