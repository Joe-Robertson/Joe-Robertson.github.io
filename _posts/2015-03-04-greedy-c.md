## Greedy.c

The third and final part of problem set 1 is the greedy problem. We had to make a program that tells the user the minimum number of coins they will recieve when they input the amount of change they are due.

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <cs50.h>
	#include <math.h>
	int main(void)
	
	{
	    int newnum, coins;
	    float change;
	    // coins is number of coins needed to make the amount of change
	    coins = 0;
	    
	    do
	    {
	        printf("How much change do you need? \n");
	        change = GetFloat();
	}
	while  (change <= 0);
	
	    newnum = (int) round(change * 100);
	        
	    while (newnum >= 25) 
	    {
	        coins++;
	        newnum = (newnum - 25);
	    }
	    while (newnum >= 10)
	    {
	        coins++;
	        newnum = (newnum - 10);
	    }
	    while (newnum >= 5)
	    { 
	        coins++;
	        newnum = (newnum - 5);
	    }
	    while (newnum >= 1)
	    {
	        coins++;
	        newnum = (newnum - 1);
	    }
	
	    printf("%d\n", coins);
	    
	    return 0;
	}
