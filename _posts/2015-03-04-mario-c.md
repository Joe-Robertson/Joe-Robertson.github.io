## Mario.c

The second task of problem set 1 is to make a program that builds a half pyramid like the ones found in the old mario games. The program must ask the user for a height and then build the half pyramid whilst keeping it all properly alligned.

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <cs50.h>
	int main(void)
	{
	    int i, h, space, hash;
	
	    do 
	    {
	        printf("Type a number from 0 to 23: \n");
	        h = GetInt();
	}
	while (h < 0 || h > 23);
	
	    for (i = 0; i < h; i++)
    	{ 
        	for (space = 0; space < (h - (i + 1)); space++)
        	{
            	printf(" ");
    	}
        	for (hash = 0; hash < (i + 2); hash++)
        	{
            	printf("#");
    	}
        	printf("\n");
	}

	return 0;
	}
