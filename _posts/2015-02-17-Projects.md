## Here's what I'm working on

At the moment I'm trying to do a few different things in my spare time. I'm taking some MOOC's on edX and coursera.

- [Harvard's cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)
- [University of Tokyo's Welcome to Game Theory](https://www.coursera.org/course/welcomegametheory)
- [University of Michigan's Introduction to Finance](https://www.coursera.org/course/introfinance)
  
I'm really keen to finish cs50 so I'll be posting my solutions to the problem sets here to keep track of those too.  
  
  

      I'm also coming to the end of [Justin Guitar's beginners course](http://www.justinguitar.com/en/BC-000-BeginnersCourse.php) and I've started the [Goodreads reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7842371-joe) for the second year running.
