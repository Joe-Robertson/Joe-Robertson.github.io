Quite a few of my goals are based around books and using them to take some action or learn something but this goal has more of a personal reason. This book is my Dad’s favourite book and he’s recommended it to me a bunch of times. While I was at University it out of the library and read quite a bit of it but I didn’t think I managed to finish it (I think now that actually I might have read it almost the whole way through!) It obviously didn’t have that much of an impact on me that time but this time it stuck a lot more and even though I finished it a few days ago I’ve still been thinking about it a lot. It seems to have quite mixed reviews online but I think it’s a really interesting idea for a book (especially seeing as its based largely on Robert Pirsig’s life) and has a lot of opinions that I agree quite strongly with myself.
 
While I was back in the UK visiting family in February I managed to grab a copy of this from one of the bookshelves in our house and brought it back with me. The cover design is really retro which is cool and the reviews for it are pretty amazing. (Can't believe it only cost 2 pound 50 for a book!!!)

It starts out with the narrator, his 11 year old son and married couple John and Sylvia Sutherland heading out on a motorcycle tour from Minneapolis. During the long periods on the road where the characters aren’t chatting the narrator describes the surrounding nature and also begins a Chautauqua (still don’t know how to pronounce that word…).  In the Chautauqua the narrator talks about how the Sutherlands can’t deal with technology because of their “romantic” approach whereas he enjoys working with it because of his “classical” approach. This all made a lot of sense and was quite easy to understand. That was just the start of it though and as the book goes on the theories and the Chautauqua get more and more complicated and dense. I found myself nodding off at times reading them on the train on the way home from work and having to leave the book for a time when I was feeling a bit more mentally alert as some paragraphs were just really complex and hard to read if you don’t have a good background in Philosophy. This is definitely a book to read at home with a cup of coffee and not while you’re being bundled around on the train after a long day in the office.
 
One of the bits I enjoyed most was the description of the journey and the way he thinks and works with the bike. They really do make you want to go on a tour across America. It sounds brilliant and if I ever get the chance I’d love to try and mimic the route and go and visit some of the places they travel through. The nature really comes to life through the narrator’s descriptions and it really emphasises the vastness of the USA. The narrator’s approach to motorcycle maintenance and the parallels made between this maintenance and Zen Buddhism were very interesting too and made me really have a long think about how I should change my approach to a lot of things in my own life. More than anything I think the book provided great inspiration to slow everything down and be more mindful which is easier said than done in the hustle and bustle of life.
 
I won’t go any further into the details of the Chautauqua as I spent a lot of time wishing the narrator would get on with the story of his past and how he is going to deal with his son in the future. Looking back on it now though I think that was an important part of the character building in the story. The inner battle between the narrator and Phaedrus is constantly on your mind when reading the book and I found myself left a bit unsure what to think when the book ended as I wasn’t sure which parts I could trust and which parts were blurred by the unreliable narrator. I’m still wrestling with the ending as I understand that the dream and everything is supposed to show that Phaedrus isn’t insane but if that’s the case then what was all the stuff about him wetting himself and staring at a wall for three days about? Did he reach enlightenment and was then brought back down to earth by Chris calling for him in the insane asylum or what? I think I still have a lot of reading around the book to do to fully understand all the symbolism etc. I’d like to read Pirsig’s second book as well this year to try and bring the thing full circle. My copy of the book didn’t have the afterword in it too and so hearing about the real Chris being murdered was very sad.
 
A thought-provoking book though and I’m glad I read it. I’d like to read more books like this really as I have a lot of questions about the world and I think these things help to give a bit of stimulus to actually mull over the big questions instead of just getting wrapped up in day-to-day busyness.
