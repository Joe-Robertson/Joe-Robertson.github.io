This one was a little bit iffy. I think I can probably say that I passed it but in the end I actually did 30 days not 31 days of yoga in March… The one day that I missed was the day I rode 106km on a bike and so I’m going to give myself that day off. Still it’s a lot more consistent than I’ve ever been before and I worked pretty hard to squeeze in sessions around work and doing other exercise. I even managed to do a few days after a bottle of wine with dinner. That was a real balance challenge...
 
For this month I did all the yoga at home and followed along with videos off a bunch of different YouTube channels. I’ve done a bit of yoga in the past but almost all of it has been just me doing stuff at home and the vast majority has been the same 30 minute David Swenson video.

That video is great and for a while I did just think about doing the same video for a month but about a month or two ago I started a 30 day yoga challenge on YouTube and did the first 5-6 days before getting distracted and stopping. I decided to finish this challenge off and then with the remaining days just found specific “flows” for bits of my body I wanted to work out (mostly yoga for runners or for hamstrings).
 
The 30 day challenge was by a yoga teacher called [Erin Motz for the channel DoYouYoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wJtQjQ4HI8&list=PLcjgXQkHWH453km2BpJqYHzmkUkkjH5IB) on YouTube. Most videos were between 15-20 mins and she introduced lots of new poses I hadn’t tried before and explained everything really nice and clearly. The level was about right for me so I did a few of her videos on her personal channel BadYogi as well after I’d finished the challenge.

I’d definitely recommend the challenge to anyone who wants to get a bit of a grounding in yoga as all the flows can be anywhere from quite challenging to pretty easy depending on how deep into the poses you go. For me the length of the videos was probably the main thing that kept me going too as finding a whole half hour slot in the evening is pretty tough but there’s always room to find a little 15 minute gap before bed. I think I would have felt more gains in terms of flexibility if I’d done 30 min sessions but it’s not all about flexibility and I did find my body felt better having done the sessions.
 
After the 30 day challenge was done I tried a few different teachers and did sessions by Yoga with Adriene, Lesley Fightmaster and BadYogi. Adriene seemed really cool and her videos were fine but sometimes they didn’t really feel like they flowed very well? Lesley Fightmaster seems like she knows her stuff but it was all a bit too lovey dovey for me and BadYogi was good but I think I preferred the videos Erin Motz did for DoYouYoga so in the end I revisited quite a few of them instead of trying me ones!

From now on I’m planning on trying to sort out a few of my recurring injuries etc. by working through Kelly Starrett’s Becoming a Supple Leopard and just doing some regular stretching to try and sort my hamstrings and hips out for running. There are a few channels on YouTube that seem to be highly recommended as well like Tim Sensei and Stephen Beitler so I’ll probably have a crack at them too sometime.
