## Half Life 2

This goal doesn’t really fit in with a lot of the others but it’s something I’ve been looking for a reason to do for a while. I was nuts about games when I was little and was always looking for new games to play or reading news about the latest developments, etc. It brought me a lot of pleasure and was probably my most consistent hobby growing up.   
 
When I was about 9 or 10 my dad got a barebones computer with just the motherboard, a processor and the box for me as a Christmas present and for the next few months every Sunday we’d go to one of my football matches and then go to a computer fair where they sold all these computer parts and other weird things they’d imported from China. We gradually got all the other bits of the computer together and by the time we were finished I’d got quite a nice gaming set-up in my bedroom.   
 
Once I’d got it set up one of the first games we got hold of was Half-Life and I remember being blown away by the action and the whole first-person experience. It ended up being one of the first games that I completed and I played all the expansion packs and counter strike too. I came to HL2 pretty late and for some reason never got round to finishing it. It didn’t seem right to not finish what was probably the biggest and most highly acclaimed game for my generation.

I don’t have a desktop anymore and my laptop isn’t the most powerful thing in the world but it managed HL2 fine and seeing as I don’t even have a proper mouse anymore I thought I might as well just play it using my xbox controller instead. Last time I played it I got to the part where you ride the hovercraft through the sewage lines but that wasn’t that far in at all so I still had lots to look forward to. 
 
I’d completely forgotten the story so it was pretty cool seeing the G-Man and Barney so early on in the beginning. There are nice throwbacks to the first game with the crowbar etc. too. I enjoyed the first bit but I remembered why I stopped when I got to the sewage bit. I don’t know what it was about that section but I just found it really boring and repetitive. After that the game started to get a bit more interesting and although I felt the story was a bit weak at times and I sometimes didn’t really know why I was going somewhere or what the point of everything was it still progressed pretty well as the weapon development and the range of new enemies etc. was all staggered quite nicely to keep the game interesting. I think I really started to enjoy the game once I got to the prison as the story started to build up from that point onward. I can’t remember too well how I did playing through the first game but I did seem to get lost and die quite a lot playing through this game. Maybe I’ve lost my well-honed reflexes!
 
The end of the game was really cool and felt quite cinematic as you battle through the city and into the citadel. I was hoping for a nice big final boss battle at the end but it all finished quite abruptly. The G-Man coming to get you was pretty cool though especially because that guy has such an awesome voice, he’s so creepy. I had to watch a few videos after it’d finished to work out what had happened as I’d forgotten all the story from the first one but I think I’ve got the gist of it now. I still haven’t played episode 1 and 2 yet but I managed to get them in the Steam Chinese New Year sale for about 200 yen each so I’ll give them a go soon so I can be ready for Half Life 3 (or Half Life 2 Episode 3?) if it ever does end up coming out!
 
It was really fun getting back into playing a game properly though and I hope from now on I can get back into playing a few of the interesting releases out there or catching up on some old classics that I haven’t had the chance to play yet. I did find that it’s really hard to play without feeling a bit guilty though. I don’t know how other people deal with this but from what I’ve read online it does seem like a pretty common thing for most people as they get older. There’s a bunch of old games like Earthbound, Grim Fandango, Chrono Trigger and Knights of the Old Republic and newer one’s like Undertale and Mass Effect that I’d like to have a crack at now so hopefully I’ll be able to find a bit of time here and there to play a few more and keep this hobby from disappearing.
