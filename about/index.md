My name is Joe. I'm 23 and I live in Japan. I'm an ALT and in all the spare time I have at school I'm trying to learn as much as possible. I'm taking some courses online and having a go at stuff first hand and this is where I'm going to document it all.

## This blog is all about:

* Japan and the Japanese language
* Learning to program 
* Getting in shape
* Travelling
* Reading and books
* Figuring out what on earth this is all about
