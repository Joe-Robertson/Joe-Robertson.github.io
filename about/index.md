My name is Joe. I'm 24 and I live in Japan. I'm a CIR and I'm trying to make the most of my time here in Japan by trying to learn lots of new things and have lots of new experiences.


## This blog is all about:

* Japan and the Japanese language
* Getting in shape
* Travelling
* Reading and books
* Figuring out what on earth this is all about
