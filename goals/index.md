It's my 25th birthday in April this year and so to celebrate being a quarter of a century old I thought I'd make some goals and try to get them finished before the big day. The list has changed a bit as there were a couple I put on originally that didn't end up being possible (like getting tickets to see the sumo! >o<). Hopefully if I can finish this it'll distract me from my inevitable quarter-life crisis! 

## The list

1)	 Join a driving school and start learning
2)	 Run 5km in under 20 minutes
3)	 Join a running club
4)	 Complete Half-Life 2
5)	 Read “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance”
6)	 Finish Justin Guitar’s “Beginners Course”
7)	 Finish the Moodgym course on CBT and mental health
8)	 Read Kelly Starrett’s “Becoming a Supple Leopard”
9)	 Join a club and start practicing Brazilian Jiu-jitsu
10)	 Finish “You can draw in 30 days” by Mark Kistler
11)	 Stay at a monastery on Mt. Koya and go to see the sunrise from the mountain top
12)	 Read one complete manga series
13)	 Finish all of the Headspace “Take …” courses in meditation
14)	 Make journaling a habit
15)	 Cycle a lap around Lake Biwa in one day (160km)
16)	 Watch all 25 “James Bond” movies
17)	 Learn about the history of England
18)	 Join a new Futsal club
19)	 Pick someone who is a good role model and learn as much as possible about them
20)	 Catch up with old friends
21)	 Learn how to cook a fancy meal
22)	 Get bodyweight over 72.5kg
